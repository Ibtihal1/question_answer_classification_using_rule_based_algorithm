# question_answer_classification_using_rule_based_algorithm
Question answering system leverage on Natural Language Processing and Other associated techniques to provide an answer to a user generated query from the data repository. In such system both the query and answer will be formulated in natural languages. A QA system attempts to extract a precise and exact answer for a given query as opposed to the general natural language-based search engines available. In other words, a QA system is simply an extension of a general Search engine. A QA system primarily consist of three major sub-processes:

	•	Query Processing and classification
	•	Information Retrieval
	•	Answer Extraction
	
Out of the given sequence of steps, Query classification phase processes the query and assigns an expected answer type to the query. This information can further be used for improving the answer extraction phase. The existing literature on the field emphasizes on the fact that, incorrect question classification is a major factor affecting the performance of such system. Hence, Question Classification module design in question answering systems is a major area of concern and an improvement in the phase could improve the overall performance of such systems.

This study attempts to understand the field better by conducting a preliminary review of seminal literature on such QA systems and specifically the question classification model in those systems. The collected literature will then be analysed on the basis of the techniques employed to tackle the problem including ML and non-ML techniques. Further, leveraging on the literature analysis thus conducted a simple rule-based question classification model is proposed to classify the given query as either descriptive or objective questions suitable for constructing a simple closed-domain QA system
